# Roly-Poly VPN
## Why?
It is a daemon designed to ease 2FA VPN usage with one time passwords at GNU/Linux systems.

## How it works
At first start it takes your permanent password, TOTP secret and Network Manager config name and places them into your keyring.
Then you can start it as a daemon and it will bring up that VPN connection using password and TOTP generated passcode. Also it will deactivate VPN connection at termination.

## Systemd
Prepared to be run as a *per-user service* but one may also try to run it system-wide, so there is a `./systemd/net-up-adm.pkla` file to deal with audit settings.

## Installation
- Import your OpenVPN configuration to NetworkManager configuration.
- Download from binary from [release page](https://github.com/nixargh/roly-poly-vpn/releases).
- Set execution bit for binary: ```chmod +x ./roly-poly-vpn```
- Move somewhere to your **PATH**. At Ubuntu I prefer `~/.local/bin/` directory: ```mv ./roly-poly-vpn ~/.local/bin/```.
- Run it and answer questions about NetworkManager VPN config name, your LDAP password and OTP secret.
If you make a mistake and want to change the value just run **roly-poly-vpn** with flag setting this secret and it will be overwritten at your keyring. Or as alternative **seahorse** utility, which is a GUI keyring manager, could be used.
- In case you like to run **roly-poly-vpn** as a **per-user systemd** service, do like this:  
```
cp ./systemd/roly-poly-vpn.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user enable roly-poly-vpn.service
systemctl --user start roly-poly-vpn.service
```

## Options
- `-noSecrets` flag diables all logic that set VPN password and OTP secret. So you can control any VPN and any other connection configured at NetworkManager.
